Hi, I'm Rachel! I recently earned my Master of Science in Statistics from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, where I also completed a Data Science minor through the university’s blended BS/MS program. My academic and professional experiences reflect a passion for statistical problem-solving, data storytelling, and collaborative work across disciplines. I was honored to receive both the Outstanding Graduate Student Award at the college and department level, as well as the Community Leadership Award, recognizing both academic excellence and meaningful contributions to the Cal Poly community.

During my time at Cal Poly, I led and contributed to several research and consulting initiatives—from developing short exact confidence intervals for the negative hypergeometric distribution to working with real clients in agriculture, life sciences, and engineering through the university’s graduate consulting practicum. I also co-authored a peer-reviewed publication on statistics education as a Frost Research Scholar and developed an AI-powered image analysis tool for the Global Emancipation Network to support anti-trafficking efforts.

Professionally, I gained hands-on experience as a Data Science Co-op at Guy Carpenter, where I built scalable dashboards in R, automated hurricane event response reporting, and validated key data inputs for catastrophe risk models. I’ve also supported over 1,000 students as a grader and lab assistant for 13 different statistics courses, helping reinforce statistical thinking and coding in R.

Beyond academia and data science, I hold a California Real Estate License and maintain a strong interest in the real estate sector, particularly where it intersects with data and housing analytics. I’m especially passionate about data visualization and take pride in crafting dashboards and analyses that are both rigorous and accessible to non-technical audiences.

Outside of work and study, I’m an avid traveler and sports enthusiast. I love skiing, pickleball, Formula 1, and soccer—all of which keep me grounded and inspired. I’m currently seeking full-time opportunities in data science, analytics, or applied research, and I’m open to relocating anywhere in the U.S.\
