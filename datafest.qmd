## Team R-sonists: C.R.A.K.ing the Code to Improve Student Learning

In Spring 2024, I competed in Cal Polyâ€™s first in-person DataFest, a 48-hour data analysis competition hosted by the Statistics Department. My team of four, The R-sonists, was challenged to analyze a real-world dataset provided by CourseKata, an organization focused on improving statistics education. We were tasked with uncovering actionable insights and delivering a concise three-slide presentation to a panel of judges.

Despite the intense time constraint, we identified key factors impacting student engagement and end-of-course (EOC) outcomes, using multivariate regression and MANOVA to support our recommendations. Our findings emphasized how specific question types and chapter sequencing could better support student learning outcomes.

Our team was honored with the Best in Show award (out of 10 teams) for the strength of our analysis and presentation. The following year, I was invited back to serve as a DataFest mentor, supporting new participants as a graduate student.
