This was my final project for this course, where my team designed and conducted a factorial experiment to investigate how different liquids (water, Coke, Diet Coke, and 2% milk) and submersion times (12, 24, and 36 hours) affected the weight of steel nails. Using a completely randomized design and two-way ANOVA, we explored main effects and interactions but ultimately found no statistically significant differences at the 5% level. Despite this, visual and descriptive patterns suggested potential effects worth investigating further in future studies.
