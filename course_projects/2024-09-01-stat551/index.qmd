For our final project in STAT 551, my team partnered with the American College of Cardiology to build a predictive tool aimed at improving diagnostic consistency for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Using real patient datasets from a multispecialty hospital in India, the CDC, and Sylhet Diabetes Hospital in Bangladesh, we developed machine learning models to identify high-risk patients across diverse populations. Our primary focus was not only on predictive performance but also on ensuring equitable outcomes for male and female patientsâ€”an important consideration in light of documented diagnostic disparities.

We began with exploratory analysis to understand gender imbalances and relationships between key clinical variables and diagnoses. Our models included logistic regression with LASSO regularization, support vector machines, and k-nearest neighbors. We evaluated model performance with ROC-AUC, sensitivity, and confusion matrices, prioritizing both accuracy and fairness. Ultimately, our approach demonstrated high sensitivity and strong predictive power, especially on the cardiovascular and early-stage diabetes datasets. The final deliverables included a comprehensive report, poster, and reflections, all highlighting the potential of data science to support fair and early medical intervention.
