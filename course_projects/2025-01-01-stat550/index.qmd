For my final project in this course, I investigated the drivers of customer foot traffic to a retail store using generalized linear models (GLMs). Starting with a Poisson regression, I identified significant overdispersion and transitioned to a negative binomial model with a log link. Through stepwise model selection guided by BIC, I built a parsimonious model incorporating centered predictors: units, income, competitor distance, and store distance. Model diagnostics confirmed a good fit, with no influential outliers and strong interpretability. I also generated predicted counts for all combinations of predictor values to demonstrate practical implications. This project emphasized rigorous model diagnostics, variable selection, and interpretation in a real-world context.
