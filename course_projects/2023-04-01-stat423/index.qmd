For our final project in this course, my team conducted a two-week factorial experiment to determine how varying amounts of water and plant food affected the growth of green onions. Using a rotatable central composite design (CCD) with uniform precision, we explored both main effects and interactions within a full quadratic model.

Although neither factor was statistically significant at the 5% level, our response surface analysis identified optimal growth conditions at 272.43 mL of water and 5.41 g of plant food, resulting in an estimated maximum growth of 5.07 cm. Interestingly, the solution corresponded to a saddle point, emphasizing the sensitivity of green onion growth to small changes in factor levels.

The project demonstrated practical application of response surface methodology and experimental design principles using JMP, while adding a creative and agricultural twist to our statistical exploration.
