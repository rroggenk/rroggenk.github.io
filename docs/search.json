    "text": "Data Wrangling Review\nSince you already seen some ggplots, let’s do a bit of review on data handling. In this class, we will exclusively make use of tools from the tidyverse suite of packages to perform our data cleaning and wrangling operations. If you are less familiar with these packages or it’s been some time since you used them, I would strongly recommend referencing the function documentation!\nFor these problems, we will continue to work with the mpg data frame, making various changes to the data to clean it up.\n\nThe fl variable describes the type of fuel for each car, with levels: p, r, e, d, and c. Do some research into what each of these labels mean! Then, use the if_else() function to create a new variable (fuel_type) with two levels: petrol (any car using petrolium-based gas) and alternative energy (any car not using petrolium-based gas).\n\n\nmpg &lt;- mpg %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    fuel_type = if_else(fl %in% c(\"p\", \"r\"), \n                        \"petrol\", \n                        \"alternative energy\")\n  )\n\n\nThe drv variable describes if the car has front drive (f), rear drive (r), or four wheel drive (4). Let’s make better labels for these values! Specifically, use the case_when() function to change the drv variable to have the following levels: front, rear, four wheel.\n\n\nmpg &lt;- mpg %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    drv = case_when(\n      drv == \"f\" ~ \"front\",\n      drv == \"r\" ~ \"rear\",\n      drv == \"4\" ~ \"four wheel\"\n    )\n  )\n\n\nThe trans variable contains two pieces of information, (1) the transmission style (auto or manual) and the specific type of transmission (e.g., l5, m5). Using the str_split() function, create a new variable (trans_type) containing the specific type of transmission of each car. Once you’ve made this new variable, use the rename() function to change the name of the trans column to trans_style.\nHint: You will need to deal with the stray parenthesis! (string split + remove extra “)” )\n\n\nmpg &lt;- mpg %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    # Split on \"(\" and take the second piece (the substring after \"(\")\n    trans_type = str_split(trans, \"\\\\(\", simplify = TRUE)[,2],\n    # Remove the trailing \")\" from that substring\n    trans_type = str_remove(trans_type, \"\\\\)\"),\n    # Split on \"(\" and take the first pierce to get the transmission style\n    trans = str_split(trans, \"\\\\(\", simplify = TRUE)[,1],\n  ) %&gt;%\n  # Rename 'trans' column to 'trans_style'\n  rename(trans_style = trans)"

    "text": "Third Data Visualization Improvement\nFor this third plot, you must use one of the other ggplot2 extension packages mentioned this week (e.g., gganimate, plotly, patchwork, cowplot).\n\nSelect a data visualization in the report that you think could be improved. Be sure to cite both the page number and figure title. Do your best to tell the story of this graph in words. That is, what is this graph telling you? What do you think the authors meant to convey with it?\n\n\nChart 5.4: Scatterplot exploring people’s perceptions of vaccine safety and vaccine effectiveness (page 112)\nThis graph is telling the reader the relationship between people’s perceptions of vaccine safety and vaccine effectiveness. It shows the percentage of a country’s people that disagree that vaccines are safe with the percentage of them who disagree that vaccines are effective. I think the authors are trying to convey the relationship between these two variables, and how they change with one another, whcih is why they aded the yellow trend line. I think they are also trying to highlight the countries that have either an abnormally high level of disagreement of people who think vaccines are safe and vaccines are effective, which is why they have some countries labeled.\n\nList the variables that appear to be displayed in this visualization.\n\nThe variables that appear to be displayed in this visualization are the countries, the percentage of people in the country’s that disagree that vaccines are safe, and the percentage of people in the country’s that disagree that vaccines are effective.\n\nNow that you’re versed in the grammar of graphics (ggplot), list the aesthetics used and which variables are specified for each.\n\n\nx-axis: percentage of people in the country’s that disagree that vaccines are safe\ny-axis: percentage of people in the country’s that disagree that vaccines are effective\ncolor: country (shows in legend)\n\nNot an aesthetic, but there is a geom_point() and a geom_smooth()\n\nWhat type of graph would you call this?\n\nI would call this type of graph a scatterplot.\n\nList all of the problems or things you would improve about this graph.\n\nThe main problem I see with this plot is that you have to tilt your head to read the y-axis label. Something I would improve about this graph is instead of just having some countires labeled, to add an interactive element where if you hover over a point, it gives you the country label along with information about the percentages for that respective country.\n\nImprove the visualization above by either re-creating it with the issues you identified fixed OR by creating a new visualization that you believe tells the same story better.\n\n\n# Compiling vaccine safety/effectiveness data \nvaccine_plot &lt;- wgm2018_full %&gt;%\n  select(country, Q25, Q26) %&gt;%\n  mutate(disagree_safe = case_when(Q25 &lt;= 3 ~ 0,\n                                   Q25 &lt;= 5 ~ 1,\n                                   TRUE ~ 0),\n         disagree_effective = case_when(Q26 &lt;= 3 ~ 0,\n                                        Q26 &lt;= 5 ~ 1,\n                                        TRUE ~ 0)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(country) %&gt;%\n  summarise(across(c(disagree_safe, disagree_effective), mean, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = disagree_safe, y = disagree_effective)) +\n  geom_point(aes(text = paste0(\"Country: \", country, \"&lt;br&gt;\",\n                               \"Disagree vaccines are safe: \", \n                               round(disagree_safe * 100, 2), \"%&lt;br&gt;\",\n                               \"Disagree vaccines are effective: \", \n                               round(disagree_effective * 100, 2), \"%\")),\n             color = \"skyblue1\", shape = 15, size = 1.8) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"yellow2\", linewidth = 0.8) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1, by = 0.1),\n                     labels = label_percent()) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1, by = 0.1),\n                     labels = label_percent()) +    \n  labs(x = NULL,\n       y = NULL)\n\n# Turn into interactive plotly plot\nggplotly(vaccine_plot, tooltip = \"text\") %&gt;%\n  layout(title = list(text = paste0(\"Scatterplot exploring people's perceptions of vaccine safety &lt;br&gt; and vaccine effectiveness\",\n                                    \"&lt;br&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Percentage of people who disagree that vaccines are safe by percentage of people who &lt;br&gt; disagree that vaccines are effective&lt;/sup&gt;\"),\n                      x = 0.01,  \n                      xanchor = \"left\"),\n         margin = list(t = 150))"
