This section showcases a range of projects completed throughout my undergraduate and graduate coursework in statistics, data science, and computer science. Each post corresponds to a specific course and highlights hands-on work applying analytical methods, computational tools, and statistical theory to real-world data problems.

Projects span topics such as machine learning, generalized linear models, survival analysis, experimental design, stochastic processes, distributed computing, and statistics education. Whether developing predictive models, analyzing sequential processes, or building interactive reports, each project reflects the applied and interdisciplinary focus of my academic experience.
